Sokokenya — Local Development

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the static server:

```bash
npm start
```

This serves the repository on `http://localhost:3000` and provides a healthcheck at `/health`.

Notes:
- Fill `supabase/config.js` with your Supabase URL and anon key for realtime and DB features.
- Do not commit real keys to the repo.
